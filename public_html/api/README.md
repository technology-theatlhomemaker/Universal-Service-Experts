# /api — lead-capture queue

PHP endpoint that accepts form submissions, writes them to a Hostinger
MySQL table, returns instantly to the user, and then forwards the row to
the Apps Script Web App in the background after the response is closed.

## Why this exists

The form used to POST directly to Apps Script `/exec`. With photos, the
user waited 5–15 seconds while Apps Script created folders and uploaded
files to Drive — long enough to hurt retention. Now:

```
browser → /api/lead.php → MySQL row + 200 OK → /thank-you/
                       └── (background) → Apps Script /exec → Drive + Sheet
```

`fastcgi_finish_request()` (PHP-FPM / LiteSpeed) closes the connection
after the INSERT, so the Apps Script call doesn't block the response.

## First-time deploy

1. **Database.** hPanel → **Databases → MySQL Databases** → create one. Note
   the host, db name, user, password.
2. **Secrets.** All values live in `.env` at the project root (gitignored).
   Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill in `DB_*`, `APPS_SCRIPT_URL`, and
   `ADMIN_TOKEN` (`php -r 'echo bin2hex(random_bytes(24));'`). Then build the
   server-side config:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-secrets.sh
   ```
   That generates `public_html/api/secrets.php` (chmod 600, gitignored).
   Upload it with the rest of `public_html/`. Re-run the script and re-deploy
   any time you change a value in `.env`.

   **Note on special characters:** wrap values containing `$`, spaces, or
   single quotes in single quotes inside `.env` (e.g. `DB_PASS='abc!$xyz'`).
3. **Migrate.** Once secrets are in place, hit:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/api/migrate.php?token=<admin_token>
   ```
   Expect `{"ok":true,"results":[{"version":"0001_create_leads_table","status":"applied"}]}`.
   Re-running is safe — already-applied migrations are skipped.
4. **Smoke test.** From your laptop:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/lead.php \
     -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
     -d '{"form_fields[name]":"Test","form_fields[field_6817b28]":"t@example.com","_form_age_ms":5000}'
   ```
   Expect `{"ok":true,"redirectUrl":"\/thank-you\/"}` within ~300ms. Check
   the `leads` table — there should be one new row, and within ~30s its
   `status` should flip from `pending` to `sent`.

## Operations

- **See pending leads:** `SELECT id, created_at, attempts, last_error FROM leads WHERE status='pending';`
- **Force a retry of all pending:** `GET /api/retry.php?token=<admin_token>`
- **Permanently failed leads** (5 attempts hit) end up in
  `status='failed'` — inspect `last_error`, fix root cause, then either
  reset (`UPDATE leads SET status='pending', attempts=0 WHERE id=...`) and
  hit retry, or replay manually.
- **Housekeeping:** old `sent` rows can be pruned periodically:
  `DELETE FROM leads WHERE status='sent' AND sent_at < (NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY);`

## Adding a migration

1. Create `migrations/NNNN_short_description.sql` where `NNNN` is one higher
   than the current max. Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS` guards where
   possible.
2. Commit it with the rest of the change.
3. After deploy, hit `/api/migrate.php?token=<admin_token>` once. New
   versions get applied; existing ones are skipped.

**MySQL caveat:** DDL (`CREATE`/`ALTER`/`DROP`) auto-commits, so a migration
that mixes DDL with a failing INSERT can leave the schema half-applied. Keep
each migration small and idempotent. If a migration fails, fix the SQL —
the `schema_migrations` row was never written, so re-running the migrate
endpoint will retry from where it stopped.

## Spam protection

Same three layers as before — moved server-side into `lead.php`:
1. Honeypot field non-empty → silent `{ok:true}`, no row written.
2. `_form_age_ms < 3000` → silent `{ok:true}`, no row written.
3. Missing `first_name` or `email` → 400 with explicit error.
